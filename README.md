Go to Project Properties and then:

1. Configuration Properties -> General -> Charater Set -> Set to: Use Unicode Character Set 
2. C/C++ -> General -> SDL Checks -> Set to: No (/sdl-)
3. Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies -> Add: winmm.lib
4. Linker -> System -> SubSystem -> Set to: Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)

For the music to work you will need to download it from here: http://dox.bg/files/dw?a=b604b30d7c
